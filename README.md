# Satoshi Tribute

## TL;DR
To mine $SATOSHI coins, send **0.06 TON** with the text **"F"** to the contract address `EQCkdx5PSWjj-Bt0X-DRCfNev6ra1NVv9qqcu-W2-SaToSHI` manually or using [web-interface](https://chiliec.github.io/Satoshi/).

## Introduction
Satoshi Tribute is a token created to honor **Satoshi Nakamoto**, the founder of blockchain technology. This project expresses gratitude for the revolutionary ideas that changed the financial system and brings the crypto community together around decentralization and innovation.

## Mining
Mining Satoshi coins is simple and fair. Send **0.06 TON** to the contract address with the text **"F"** to initiate mining. The mining probability depends on the number of attempts and the time since the last block. The probability is described in the following chart:

![Probability vs Minutes Since Last Block](docs/figure.png)

- Probability **increases over time** and **decreases with the number of attempts**.
- No extra fees, pre-mining, or hidden mechanisms: **equal opportunities for all**.
- Every **210,000 blocks (~4 years)**, the mining reward is halved, just like Bitcoin.

## Smart Contract Transparency
- Built on **proven blockchain technology**.
- The mining probability algorithm is **fully open-source**.
- The code is available in the [Probability.tact](contracts/traits/Probability.tact) file for full transparency and security.

## Project Structure
- **`contracts`** - Source code of all smart contracts and dependencies.
- **`wrappers`** - Wrapper classes for contracts, implementing `Contract` from `ton-core`.
- **`tests`** - Test cases for the smart contracts.
- **`scripts`** - Deployment and automation scripts.
- **`utils`** - Utilities for scripts and UI.
- **`docs`** - Documentation.

## Smart Contract Usage
### Build
Run the following command to compile the contracts:
```
npx blueprint build
```

### Test
Run the tests with:
```
npx blueprint test
```
